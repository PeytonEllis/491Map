  <h2> Molly's Research Question:  How has the broader food culture affected the sale of peas in the United States?  How were people eating and why were they eating that way?</h2>
  <h2>The Poison Squad Deborah Blum </h2>
    <h3>Pure Food Act 1906</h3> 
      <h4>Feb 1906: Canning industry largely backed the Pure Food Act</h4>
      <p>Wiley “restated his belief that the canners’ mushrooming use of dyes and preservatives, often to disguise poor-quality food, was driving consumers away from American products.  ‘Honesty is what the American public demands and canned goods will have an ever-growing market as long as people are confident that the goods are free from anything injurious” (Blum, 140)</p>
      <p>Weakened in the 1920s and 30s (was strengthened in 1938) </p>
      <p>1927: The Bureau of Chemistry was split into two: the Food, Drug, and Insecticide Administration (which handled consumer protection duties), and the Bureau of Chemistry and Soils (which focused on more basic agricultural research) (283) </p>
      <p>1930s: “In a scathing book on the county’s health policies, 100,000,000 Guinea Pigs, the founders of the Consumers’ Union stated flatly, ‘Pure food laws do not protect you’ and provided instances of everything from fake antiseptics to mascaras thick with lead to apples tainted with arsenic-rich pesticides.” (285)</p>
    
      <h4>White Bread Aaron Bobrow-Strain </h4>
      <p>People’s relationships with industrial food</p>
      <p>Anxiety about industrialized foods in the 1920s (particularly when the economy was good)</p> 
      <p>“Tapping into a much older line of American religious tradition, noted food gurus of the late 1920s and 1930s worried that industrial bread might erode moral behavior.” (98) </p>
      <p>“1929, in bold type arrayed around a large picture of white bread, the New York Evening Graphic declared, ‘Criminals are made by the food that they eat as children—Science finds that white bread develops criminals.’ For many household advisors and dietary experts, as the next chapter shows, industrialization had gone too far.” (98, 99) </p>
      <p>“a deep and abiding belief in the ability to fine-tune and maximize the moral and physical health of my body and my nation by eating the right food—an irrepressible confidence in the power of proper diet to cure almost all physical and social ills. This dream, in turn, has long reflected deeper concerns about the nature of industrial progress, society’s relation to nature and, of course, anxiety about status. Not surprisingly, wheat and bread have played a major role in this history.” (128,129) </p>

  <h4>What is our audience going to do with this information? :</h4> 
  <p>The information from our canned food map and research could help historians gain a deeper understanding of Bozeman’s canning industry of the late 1920s, as well as the distribution patterns around the United States.</p> 

  <h4>What is the importance?:</h4> 
  <p>Despite growing anxiety about industrialized foods in the United States, Bozeman’s canning industry was large and growing. The canning industry helped to shape parts of Montana. Tracking the growth and death of industries allows historians to better understand the broader economy. The growth and distribution of canned peas also reveals important information about American foodways.  The canning industry was in the middle of the food adulteration crisis that led to the Pure Food Act, though it was passed in 1909, problems with food adulteration persisted until 1938.  </p>


  <h4>What is the form of our project (Map) and why? :</h4> 
  <p>The map itself adds a visual component to our research. It provides researchers a more hands on experience and allows them to visually connect the dots. Visuals can be a more effective educational tool than written documents alone. This map also creates a more organized summary of the artifacts (canning labels, newspaper clippings, and journal entries) which saves researchers time and may help them to find more meaning in the artifacts themselves. </p>
