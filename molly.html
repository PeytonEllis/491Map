  <h2> Molly's Research Question:  How has the broader food culture affected the sale of peas in the United States?  How were people eating and why were they eating that way?</h2>
 <p>The pea canning industry in Bozeman was in the middle of a major change in food which occurred in the early twentieth century.  Across the country were horrific instances of dangerous food adulteration.  The first major public outcry over the food industries occurred when it was revealed that spoiled canned beef had been fed to American soldiers in 1898 (Blum, 51).  It was later discovered that both meat and milk were being preserved with formaldehyde (57, 61).  It was instances like these that led to the passing of the Pure Food Act in 1906.  The canning industry supported the Pure Food Act because they believed that the mushrooming use of preservatives and dies – used to disguise lower quality foods – were harming the reputation of their business (140).  Though the Pure Food Act was passed in the beginning of the twentieth century, it wasn’t until 1938 that regulation was strong enough to insure the safety of food. </p> 
<p>In the 1920’s people began to dislike industrial foods.  This shift is best shown through the demonization of industrial white bread and reverence of wholesome, homemade wheat loaves.  Some believed that white bread was eroding moral behavior (Bobrow-Strain, 98).  Others went as far as to claim that white bread made criminals (98, 99).  Many feared that there was something wrong with white bread itself.  The over-processing of the flour itself was believed to be making Americans fat, lazy, sick, and weak (130).  While the affluence of the 1920’s undoubtedly played a role in the shift away from industrial foods, anxieties about industrial foods show a growing tension about industrialization in general (128, 129).  </p>
<p>The resilience of the canning industry in Bozeman despite the growing tensions about industrial foods reveals the true nature of the success of the industry.  </p>
<p>The pea canning industry in Bozeman survived and thrived despite growing tensions about industrial foods.  The success of this industry played a crucial role in the growth of a few towns in Montana.  The canning industry in the United States seemed to care about the purity and quality of their foods, the success of the industry in Bozeman shows that they shared these values.  </p>
