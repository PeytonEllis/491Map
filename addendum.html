  <h2>Addendum</h2>

    <p>In Special Collections, our group was presented with several canning labels along with a lot of artifacts from Mrs. Lou Stewart Stocking. In fact, the majority of our artifacts were her items; including name tags and ribbons from several events, diaries, and invitations to social events. In light of having these artifacts presented together, our group thought that there must be a connection between the canning industry and Lou Stocking.</p>

    <p>Going off of the social event invitations in our artifacts, Ellis’s research question aimed to discover how Lou Stewart Stocking related to the canning industry and therefore what role she played in the distribution of these products, if canning sales/distribution was part of her role at these events. Following this research, I found that Lou “...was a prolific writer, keeping extensive diaries and later in life writing summaries about her life in Montana. Her comments concerning her journey up the Missouri River on the Red Cloud and the freight that the boat carried adds support to the notion that Fort Benton had become, by 1880, the freighting mecca on the Great Plains” (The Life and Times of the Steamboat Redcloud, 109). I thought that her connection to the Red Cloud would connect to her role in the distribution of canned goods from Montana, but following this train of thought all I was able to discover was that although she lived in Fort Benton in the 1880s, when it was becoming the fastest growing town in Montana, she didn’t have a hand in the canning industry. The closest connection I could find was her husband Albert’s management of sheep ranches.</p>

    <p>The Bozeman Canning Company, along with other Montana canning companies, distributed their peas and beans all throughout the US. Erica’s research question targeted the connection between Lou Stocking and the distribution of the Peas. The question I was aiming to answer was: Did Lou Stocking Stewart play a dominant role in the distribution of the peas and the locations that were marketed to. Lou Stocking moved to Fort Benton in Red lodge, MT after getting married to Albert Stewart. Albert was a sheep farmer in Montana. Meanwhile, Lou was busy joining many clubs, some of which included : Society of Montana Pioneers, Montana Federated Women’s Clubs and Grand Army of the Republic Women’s Relief Corps. Lou was very involved in these clubs and associations. We were presented with artifacts that showed many of the ribbons she had, as well as journals that had detailed information about her roles, and the day to day life she and her husband experienced. Unfortunately none of which included the Canning Company. Where the couple lived, at Fort Benton, was a very popular port for steam ships during this time. Many products went in and out of this port, which could have included the Peas. In 1926, the company production Line for Montana Pea Company was in Red Lodge, MT. This could have been the connection between the Stewart Family and the canning company. There may have been production or just distribution through Red lodge in Fort Benton, that had to go through the property, owned by the Stewarts, to get out and be distributed. </p>

    <p>When we both concluded that there was no connection between Lou Stewart Stocking and the canning industry, we found that the artifacts we were presented in Special Collections were unintentionally placed with the canning labels that were intended to be a part of this assignment. Although Lou was not connected to our research directly, it did lead to interesting research amongst our group mates about the role of women as a whole in this industry at the time, along with other research that stemmed from this connection that we only later discovered to be nonexistent.</p>
