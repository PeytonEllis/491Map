  <h2>Courtney’s Research Question: The number and broad reach of canned products shipped across America from Bozeman indicates that this was a successful industry during the 1920s. Did women play a role in the canning process? How is Bozeman’s canning industry connected to women and gender?</h2>

  <p>Women played an important role in Bozeman’s canning industry. According to the Cannery District’s website, “The cannery was open 15-20 hours a day during peak harvest, employing 250-275 people. Because of the selective service draft during World War II, high school students and housewives were the backbone of the cannery workforce along with retirees, migrant workers, the not yet drafted, and hoboes.” The Cannery District was an important piece of Bozeman’s economy in the years 1926 and 1927. Understanding the role the canning industry played can provide a more accurate picture of the scope and influence of the canning industry overall. </p>
  <p> The period following WWI and the start of the Great Depression in Montana (around 1918) lead to an increased need for canned goods in Montana, and more broadly, in America. While many rural Montana women focused on growing and preserving their own food at home, canned goods were an important staple in many diets. After WWII there was a shift throughout America towards consumerism and “time saving” domestic activities within the home. Part of the Montana Extension Service’s goal was to encourage and educate Montana women on canned foods. This not only benefited the Bozeman Canning Company financially, but was also a successful source of revenue that helped the Bozeman community overall. In the article titled, From Canning to Contraceptives, McKinney explains that “By 1955, consumerism had become more integral to Home Demonstration lessons. Forty percent of the Extension nutritionists time was devoted to providing marketing information for consumers. In her reports from 1958 through 1962, State Extensionist Mary E. Loughead emphasized the importance of disseminating food-buying information to rural women” (McKinney, 64). Since most Montanans had home gardens and were knowledgeable about canning their own produce, there was a need for the Extension Service to educate Montana women on the purchase of canned goods. McKinney goes on to explain that, “The Extension Service offered lessons on “Buying Canned Foods” and “Food Facts and Fallacies,” which focused on understanding nutritional content on labels and how to spot misleading or false statements in food advertisements.” (McKinney, 64). This national shift towards consumerism can be seen in our map as well. Canned goods were being shipped from Bozeman throughout America, particularly to the Southeast and Midwest. Cooking and food consumption were delegated to the “sphere of domesticity” and were considered part of women’s roles during this period of US history. We can conclude that women are closely tied to the canning industry, both as producers in Bozeman’s cannery district, and as consumers throughout America.  </p>
  <p>Our map shows that more canned vegetables were shipped to more southern and east coast areas during the years 1926 and 1927. This could imply that canned goods were more important in the Southeast, Midwest, and urban areas and could partially explain the push towards consumerism and for Montana women to buy more canned food products. </p>
