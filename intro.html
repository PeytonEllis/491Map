  <h3> Artifacts & Importance:</h3>

    <p>This collection from Lou Stocking Stewart includes various canning labels, name tag ribbons, organizations, and newspaper clippings about the Stocking and Stewart families. The Bozeman canning industry had a substantial influence on the development and economic success of Montana communities as is shown by the newspaper articles about Lou Stocking Stewart’s social engagements, parties, and involvement in various organizations. We intend to use the canning labels, invitations, newspaper clippings, letters, and ribbons from 1926-27 as the basis of our analysis. The data analysis will include the physical locations of each item, where the canned products were shipped to, and numbers of items shipped to different locations.</p>

  <h3>Intended Audience:</h3>

    <p>Montana History scholars looking to analyze the success and influence of the Montana canning industry during the years of 1926 and 1927 are the intended audience for the information and analysis based on these artifacts. This area of research is important to better understand Bozeman’s economy and influence during these years.</p> 

  <h3>Data Analysis Entails:</h3> 

    <p>I will make a map that includes the labels from the cans. It will show the locations that the Montana Canning Company distributed to from the dates 1926-1927.</p> 

  <h3>How Will The Analysis Benefit Your Argument:</h3>

    <p>This data will show the impact that the Canning company had on the rest of the United States. It will show the large area that was covered, all from the canning company in Montana during the time period, and the distribution patterns throughout the different states.</p>
